The following is the list of the possible filters to implement into the camera device user program:

1- Negative: inverts the colors in the entire picture.

2- Increment brightness: as its name suggests, this filter will increment the brightness levels in a picture.

3- Red coloration: changes all the colors in the picture to a more red tone.

4- Grayscale: a very popular filter, changes the color scheme to a grayscale.

5- Pixelated: makes the picture look more pixelated, giving the impression that it has a lower quality.
